You have been asked by the customer account manager at your company to
develop an account microservice to keep track of the customers
on your e-commerce website. Since it is a microservice, it is expected
to have a well-formed REST API that other microservices can call.
This service initially needs to create, read, update, delete,
and list customers.

You have also been told that someone else has started on this task.
They have already developed the database model and a Python
Flask-based REST API with an endpoint to create a customer account.

Tasks that need to be completed:
- Create and execute sprint plans
- Develop a RESTful Service using Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Add Continuous Integration (CI) and Security to the Repository
- Deploy the application to Kubernetes
- Build an automated CD DevOps Pipeline
